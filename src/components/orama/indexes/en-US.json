		"content": "Migrating from Anycubic Photon Workshop? Heads up! * Because Anycubic Photon Workshop offers both Basic and Advanced settings, and CHITUBOX's format lacks a dedicated field to differentiate them, CHITUBOX only displays Basic parameters for printers that do not support Advanced settings. Conversely, CHITUBOX displays only Advanced parameters for printers that support both settings. If your printer supports Advanced settings but you do not want to use the TSMC feature, simply enter the same speed for both stages, and ensure the total lift distance is consistent with the desired distance. * The order of TSMC parameters in the UI is different. In Photon Workshop, [0] refers to the motion stage closer to the screen, while [1] represents the stage farther away. However, CHITUBOX follows the motion order in layout input boxes. There are two sets of lifting and retracting parameters in the print settings, where you can set up TSMC. \n There are two sets of lifting and retracting parameters in the print settings, where you can set up TSMC. When the build plate starts lifting with the model, the FEP film at the bottom of the resin vat will pull down the newly solidified layer until it is detached from the layer. This is called the 'suction effect'. The suction effect is more prominent when the contact area with the FEP film is large and when the build plate pulls away at higher speeds. The suction effect can cause the model to deform, and even cause the model to fall off the build plate. We recommend keeping the lifting speed slow until the model is detached from the FEP film. As the suction effect is no longer a concern, speeding up the lifting speed afterwards can improve the printing efficiency. The principle acts similarly in the retracting stage. You can adjust the following parameters below to get familiar with TSMC: https://manual.chitubox.com/en-US/chitubox-basic/latest/ui-and-features/configure-print-parameters#tsmc-two-stage-motion-control"
