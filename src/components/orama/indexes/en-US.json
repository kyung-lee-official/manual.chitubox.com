		"content": "Migrating from Anycubic Photon Workshop? Heads up! * Because Anycubic Photon Workshop offers both Basic and Advanced settings, and CHITUBOX's format lacks a dedicated field to differentiate them, CHITUBOX only displays Basic parameters for printers that do not support Advanced settings. Conversely, CHITUBOX displays only Advanced parameters for printers that support both settings. If your printer supports Advanced settings but you do not want to use the TSMC feature, simply enter the same speed for both stages, and ensure the total lift distance is consistent with the desired distance. * The order of TSMC parameters in the UI is different. In Photon Workshop, [0] refers to the motion stage closer to the screen, while [1] represents the stage farther away. However, CHITUBOX follows the motion order in layout input boxes. There are two sets of lifting and retracting parameters in the print settings, where you can set up TSMC. \n There are two sets of lifting and retracting parameters in the print settings, where you can set up TSMC. When the build plate starts lifting with the model, the FEP film at the bottom of the resin vat will pull down the newly solidified layer until it is detached from the layer. This is called the 'suction effect'. The suction effect is more prominent when the contact area with the FEP film is large and when the build plate pulls away at higher speeds. The suction effect can cause the model to deform, and even cause the model to fall off the build plate. We recommend keeping the lifting speed slow until the model is detached from the FEP film. As the suction effect is no longer a concern, speeding up the lifting speed afterwards can improve the printing efficiency. The principle acts similarly in the retracting stage. You can adjust the following parameters below to get familiar with TSMC: https://manual.chitubox.com/en-US/chitubox-basic/latest/ui-and-features/configure-print-parameters#tsmc-two-stage-motion-control"

The length of each voxel is the length of each pixel on the screen, while the width of each voxel is the width of each pixel on the screen. A voxel is the smallest unit that constitutes a print.

The Bottom Exposure Time applies to the first number of layers set by this parameter. Exposure Time: Exposure time of normal print layers. Bottom Exposure Time:Set the exposure time of the bottom layers. increasing the exposure time of the bottom layers helps increase the bond strength between the printing model and the printing platform. Transition Layer Count: The number of transition layers between the print bottom layers and the normal print layers. when printing in transition layers, the exposure time will decrease with the increase of printing layers. Other printing settings in the transition layers are the same as normal layers. Transition Type: Set the transition type of the exposure time for the transition layers. Waiting Mode During Printing: Resting Time: Rest Time Before Lift: A time interval between light-off and the build plate starts to lift. Rest Time After Lift: A time interval between the build plate lifts to the Lifting Distance and starts to retract. Rest Time After Retract: A time interval between the build plate retracts to the lowest point and light-on. Light off Delay: Light-off delay is the total time of build plate lifts up, wait, and retract. Light-off delay is the total time of build plate lifts up, wait, and retract. Light-off Delay: Light-off delay for normal layers, Actual machine light-off time = maximum (total time of Z-axis up and down movement, configured light-off delay). Bottom Light-off Delay: Light-off delay for bottom layers, Actual machine light-off time = maximum (total time of Z-axis up and down movement, configured light-off delay). Bottom Lift Distance: The distance of the printing platform moves away from the printing surface each time during bottom layers printing process. Lifting Distance: The distance of the printing platform moves away from the printing surface each time during normal layers printing process. Bottom Retract Distance: The distance of retract, leave it alone unless you have sufficient reason during bottom layers printing process. Retract Distance:The distance of retract, leave it alone unless you have sufficient reason during normal layers printing process. Bottom Lift Speed: The speed of the printing platform moves away from the printing surface each time during bottom layers printing process. Lifting Speed: The speed of the printing platform moves away from the printing surface each time during normal layers printing process. Bottom Retract Speed: The speed of the printing platform moves to the printing surface each time during bottom layers printing process.

		"content": " Note for Anycubic Users: Please note if you come from Anycubic Photon Workshop: Anycubic Photon Workshop has basic settings and advanced settings, which are not differentiated in CHITUBOX formats. CHITUBOX only displays basic settings for printers not compatible with advanced settings. And only advanced settings are displayed for printers supporting both. You can also enter the same speed for the two stages and make sure that the total lift distance meets requirements if you do not want to use TSMC on a printer supporting advanced settings. The order in which TSMC parameters are displayed in the UI is different for Anycubic Photon Workshop, where [0] indicates the motion stage close to the screen and [1] indicates the motion stage further from the screen. However, the parameters are displayed following the motion pattern in CHITUBOX, which might be confusing at first. There are two groups of lift and retract parameters in print settings for setting up TSMC. As the print platform lifts up with the model, the FEP film at the bottom of the resin vat pulls on the layer that is just cured until the layer detaches from the film. The suction effect is stronger when the model has larger contact areas with the FEP film and when the platform lifts up at higher speeds. The suction effect may cause the model to deform or even pull the model down from the print platform. We suggest that you should keep the lift process slow until the model detaches from the film. The lift can be accelerated when suction effect is no longer a concern to improve print efficiency. And the retract process follows the same principle."

Bottom Tolerance Compensation is usually used to resolve the 'elephant trunk' effect due to long exposure time. Tolerance compensation works by labeling the inner diameter (a) and outer diameter (b) of each layer of the exposed image, and then adjusting the size of the inner and outer diameters according to the tolerance compensation values. When a is larger, the inner diameter is shorter. When a is smaller, the inner diameter is longer. When b is larger, the outer diameter is longer. When b is smaller, the outer diameter is shorter. NOTE: When the bottom layer tolerance compensation is disabled, the normal layer tolerance compensation will be effective for the whole model. Tolerance compensation works by check the inner diameter (a) and outer diameter (b) of each layer, not by scaling 3D models directly. As a result your models should not have sudden changes in inner and outer diameters (i.e. inner diameter changes to outer diameter or vice versa at a certain height). For example, such changes to a slice file may happen for a vertical tube with an horizontal hole at a certain height. Bottom tolerance compensates only affects bottom layers. When transition layer compensation and bottom tolerance compensation are both enabled, the print result may be not be as good as expected."

The grayscale increases from left to right as a result of averaging out every 51 pixels. Take the first row as an example: The first 51 pixels include 50 black pixels and 1 white pixel. The resulting average value is a tint lighter than pure black, barely noticeable to the naked eyes. The second group of 51 pixels contains 49 white pixels and 2 black pixels, averaging out to a color slightly darker than white. The third group of 51 pixels will be masked to the average grayscale of 48 dark pixels and 3 white pixels and so on, until we reach the remaining 35 odd pixels. Dividing 800 by 51 equals to 15, remainder 35. This remaining pixels' gray scale will be the average of 35 pixels of the same shade. Therefore, the resulting grayscale doesn't change."
