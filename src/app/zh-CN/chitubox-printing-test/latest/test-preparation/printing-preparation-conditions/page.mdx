# Printing Preparation Conditions

## Printing Environment

1. Printing verification The indoor ambient temperature should be stably controlled at 18~ 28 â„ƒ.
1. Printing verification The indoor ambient humidity should be controlled not to exceed 60%.
1. Printing verification process The printer needs to be kept away from heat sources, water sources and vibration sources.
1. During the printing verification process, it is necessary to ensure regular air circulation in the room to reduce and avoid the odor emitted by the resin liquid inhaled by the personnel in the printing room.
1. During the printing verification process, no light or weak blue light should be kept in the room. It is recommended to use a yellow light source for low-light light sources. During the whole printing process, it is necessary to ensure that the hood of the printer is completely closed.
1. During the printing verification process, the power supply must meet the grounding requirements, and cannot share the wiring circuit with high-current equipment. The printing process needs to ensure the stability of the power supply voltage.
1. During the printing verification process, do not place volatile solvents such as water and alcohol in the printing room to avoid interfering quality problems during the printing and molding process.
1. The power supply voltage and current of the printing verification process need to be strictly implemented in accordance with the power supply requirements of the printer equipment.

## Printer

1. The printer needs to be installed and placed in a hard level area.
1. Detect and confirm that the release film is not damaged, the release film is clean, and the release film is normally tensioned.
1. Detect and confirm that the light source and image display device are normal.
1. Detect and confirm the corresponding light intensity value after the light source and imaging area are fully lit during normal printing use.
1. Detect and confirm that the imaging work area bonded with the release film is clean and free of impurities.
1. Detect and confirm that the printer printing platform is locked normally.
1. Detect and confirm that there are no residual objects on the printing platform.
1. Check and confirm that the printing platform is leveled normally.
1. Check and confirm that the resin tank is properly installed and locked.

When confirming the printer, it is necessary to confirm the sampling test of the corresponding light intensity of the printer through Article 4 of the above precautions.

The light intensity measurement device selected for the corresponding light intensity sampling test verification needs to use the following equipment and strictly follow the corresponding instructions to complete the test of the corresponding light intensity value.

<Admonition type={"warning"}>
	The light intensity measuring device needs to be uniformly measured
	according to the use band of the corresponding printer.
</Admonition>

For the selected printer product, it is necessary to measure and record the corresponding light intensity value at a fixed interval according to the following diagram. The corresponding area does not fully specify the corresponding measurement position, and it is necessary to satisfy the complete fit between the light intensity measuring device and the image forming surface. The light intensity values need to be measured and recorded 5 times respectively, and the corresponding average value is obtained according to the corresponding point measurement value.

<Admonition type={"note"}>
	The above content is mainly for the preparation process of pull-up
	photocurable 3D printing, and does not include the preparation instructions
	of the sink printer, which are hereby described.
</Admonition>

## Printing Materials

1. Check and confirm that the printing material is normal and not expired.
1. Detect and confirm that the printing materials added in the resin tank are evenly mixed without impurities.
1. Detect and confirm that the printing material added in the resin tank is sufficient and will not overflow during the printing process.

## Preparation of Printing Documents

### Model Layout Preprocessing Preparation

#### Single Model Layout

<Admonition type={"note"}>
	A single model is repeated many times to adjust the parameter layout test
	verification. It is necessary to ensure that the printing model is in the
	same position relative to the same printer. The example position is as
	follows.
</Admonition>

<ImageContainer src="/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-printing-test/1.x.x/test-preparation/single-model_001.png" />

<Admonition type={"tip"}>
	The position of the corresponding model relative to the platform can select
	the corresponding model, trigger the move button, and click the
	corresponding model to view and confirm.
</Admonition>

#### Multi-Model Typography

<Admonition type={"note"}>
	When multiple models are repeated multiple times for print test
	verification, it is necessary to ensure that the position of the print
	models relative to the same printer remains the same.
</Admonition>

#### Adjustment Of Support Parameters

Part of the test verification model has three types of support models corresponding to CHITUBOX, which can effectively test the parameter effectiveness of the corresponding contact point spacing when the corresponding coarse, medium and fine supports are supported. The test of the support structure of other parameters can also be passed. The secondary editing and setting of the model support structure are tested and verified.

### Printing Parameter Setting And Preparation

Detailed printing parameter setting instructions can be seen on <SpanA href="https://manual.chitubox.com/en-US/chitubox-pro/latest/setting-up/configure-print-parameters">ðŸ“–user manual</SpanA>.

The following table records the description of the effect of different printing parameter settings of CHITUBOX Pro software on the printing file and printing effect, which can be used as a guide for optimal printing parameter adaptation and adjustment.

### Slice Preprocessing

CHITUBOX Pro software has two slicing modes: single-parameter and multi-parameter slicing. Effective use of multi-parameter slicing can obtain better printing parameters more quickly when testing and confirming the best printing parameters, and further obtain better printing actual results.
