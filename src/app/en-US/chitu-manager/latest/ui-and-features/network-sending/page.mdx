# Network Sending

<Admonition type="note">
	1. Some printers may require a USB drive to store sliced files if internal storage is not supported.
	1. Network sending requires the printer and the computer to be under the same local area network (LAN).
	1. The transmission speed is limited by printer's network module. Most printers limit the transimission speed to 8M/s. Large files are not recommended for **Network Sending**. 
	1. Only some printers support Network Sending. Read the <SpanA href="https://wkhvloo2kw.feishu.cn/docx/Q5nbdGSnfo5EbAxgEwKccN0Rnxe">ðŸ“ƒfull compatibility list</SpanA> here.

Edit the file name and choose the format for the sliced file. Then choose the printer you want to use from the printer list or the "My Printer" list. Click the "**Send**" button at the bottom right corner to start saving and transferring the file.

A temporary file is saved before transfer starts. This file is used during the transfer process and is automatically deleted when you close the CHITUBOX slicer.

Once saved, the file will be transferred to the printer.
