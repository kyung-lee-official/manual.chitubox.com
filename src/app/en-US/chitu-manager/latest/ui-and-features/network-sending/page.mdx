# Network Sending

<Admonition type="note">
	1. Some printers may require a USB drive to store sliced files if internal storage is not supported.
	1. Network sending requires the printer and the computer to be under the same LAN.
	1. The transmission speed is limited by printer's network module. Most printers limit the transimission speed to 8M/s. Large files are not recommended for **Network Sending**. 
	1. Only some printers support Network Sending. Read the <SpanA href="https://wkhvloo2kw.feishu.cn/docx/Q5nbdGSnfo5EbAxgEwKccN0Rnxe">ðŸ“ƒfull compatibility list</SpanA> here.

Once you've modified the file name and selected the appropriate format for the sliced file, pick the printer you want to use from the scanned printer list or "My Printer" list. Then, click the "**Send**" button in the bottom right corner to start saving and transferring the file.

A temporary file is saved before transferring the file. This file is used for the transfer process and is automatically deleted when you close the CHITUBOX slicer.

Once saved, the file will be transferred to the printer.
