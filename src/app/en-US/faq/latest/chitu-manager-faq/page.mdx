# ChituManager FAQ

## Dll File Missing

If you encounter an error message "xxx.dll Missing" when launching the software, follow these steps:

1. Open Control Panel, click on **Programs** option and then click **Programs and Features**.

1. Locate ChituManager and uninstall it. If you find multiple ChituManager programs, you need to uninstall all of them.

1. Close all third-party antivirus software on your computer. 

1. Open CHITUBOX slicer, find the ChituManager icon in the top right corner, and click the icon to download and install it.

1. (For cases where antivirus software is not disabled promptly) If the antivirus software prompts to block files during the download process, select "Allow this operation".

## Unable To Open ChituManager

If clicking the Network Sending button or the ChituManager icon doesn't open the program like it's supposed to, you can follow these steps to troubleshoot the problem:

1. Close CHITUBOX slicer.

1. Invoke the Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc.

1. Locate and end all running ChituManager task.

1. Restart the CHITUBOX slicer.

Once you restart the software, the Network Management and Network Sending features should work as expected.

## Software Launches with a Blank Screen

If you find that the page is blank after launching ChituManager, the data may be corrupted. Clean up the software data to resolve this issue:

1. Navigate to the following file path:

    - Windows:

    ```shell
    C:\Users\{user-name}\AppData\Local\ChituManager
    ```

    - Mac:

    ```shell
    Macintosh HD/Users/{user-name}/Library/Application Support/ChituManager
    ```

1. Delete the üìÅ"cbdsa-chitubox-network" and üìÅ"DataBase" folders inside the folder.

1. Restart ChituManager.

## Network Sending Issues

If you're experiencing problems with network sending features, such as not finding printers, file sending failure, or a sluggish transfer progress bar, you can check the following reasons:

-   Network Connection:

    Ensure both your computer and the printer are connected to the same local area network (LAN).

-   Firewall Settings:

    Check if your firewall is blocking ChituManager. If that happens, it will not be able to detect your printer.

-   Filename Characters:

    Avoid using non-English or non-numeric characters in filenames. These characters can sometimes cause problems when sending files.
