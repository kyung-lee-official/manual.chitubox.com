## Windows Issues

### Windows Explorer Keep Restart Repeatedly

If your Windows Explorer keeps restarting repeatedly, please follow these steps to fix it:

Invoke your Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc, right-click Windows Explorer, then click Restart.

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/en-US/faq/chitubox-basic/1.x.x/faq002.png"}
/>

In your Task Manager, click File > Run new task, input `cmd`, check **Create this task with administrative privileges**, then click **OK**.

Input:

```shell
regsvr32 /u "{CHITUBOX-Installation-Path}\CHITUBOX_Thumbnail.dll"
```

Note you need to replace `{CHITUBOX-Installation-Path}` with your CHITUBOX's installation path, for example:

```shell
regsvr32 /u "C:\Program Files\ChiTubox\CHITUBOX_Thumbnail.dll"
```

Hit Enter to run it.

### Conflict with Fusion 360 or Failed to create OpenGL context for format QSurfaceFormat

Please open System Settings> About> Advanced System Settings and remove the environment variable `QT_OPENGL`.

### This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized

Please open System Settings> About> Advanced System Settings and remove the two environment variables `QT_OPENGL` and `QT_PLUGIN_PATH`.

### CHITUBOX is Not Responding

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/en-US/faq/chitubox-basic/1.x.x/faq008.png"}
/>

Most likely it is a software conflict issue, please quit your runtime software one by one to track down which software conflicts with CHITUBOX. After this is done, the problem should be solved for most cases.
The following software may cause the conflict:

-   Anti-virus software

-   Tabtip (In Windows Task Manager it is called Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel)

-   PowerToys

-   Google Drive

## Authorization Code Issues

### Error "SSL handshake failed"

If the system time does not match the current actual date, activating an authorization code may be affected and result in an "SSL handshake failed" error message.

To resolve this issue, you can set the system time automatically (recommended) or manually. Then restart the software and activate the code.

## Plugin Issues

### Longer Error -1

1. Longer's control board process the resolution specially, we have confirmed the correct resolution x: 960, y: 1708. We have double-check and confirmed this, so please don't change it.

2. `Error code -1` After changing the resolution is an error in the internal code of the plug-in. Because you changed the resolution, an error was reported.

Download Longer plugin <SpanA href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1rPRw68b3Z1oqLwc7hSmP5A9Zx0HjatbE?fbclid=IwAR2XyvSs_jCWwqXymOh9ZEvcuyKNuj-ibnmbLAmfOsZMWzjJdke71kxANwQ">here</SpanA>.

**Restart Explorer**

Invoke your Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc , right-click Windows Explorer, then click Restart.

### Surface of Models Go Rough after Slicing

When you load a CTB file back to CHITUBOX, you may notice that the surface of the model is rough, in fact, this is because each voxel of the model was rendered after sliced. As if you can clearly see the each pixel after you zoom in an image in Photoshop.

As it is shown in the figure, the height of each voxel is the layer height set in the slice setting. The length of each voxel is the length of each pixel on the screen, while the width of each voxel is the width of each pixel on the screen. A voxel is the smallest unit that constitutes a print.

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/en-US/faq/chitubox-basic/1.x.x/faq005.png"}
	style={{ maxwidth: "400px" }}
/>

<Admonition type="note">
	This voxel image cannot be seen during the preview after the slicing. You
	need to reload the .ctb file in CHITUBOX to see it.
</Admonition>

### Why STL files were scaled after importing to CHITUBOX?

An STL file doesn't contain the exact unit, it only contains numbers. Therefore, different software read an STL in different units. For example, when using STL file, 1m exported from Blender will be read as 1mm in CHITUBOX. You need to test the corresponding proportion of your 3D modeling software and CHITUBOX before you export your models.

## Other Issues

For some reason, you might encounter other issues caused by data corruption between versions. You can try the following ways to solve issues:

### Clean the Cache

1. Navigate to the following directory:

    - Windows:

    ```shell
    C:\Users\{user-name}\AppData\Local
    ```

    - Mac:

    ```shell
    Macintosh HD/Users/{user-name}/Library/Application Support
    ```

	- Ubuntu:

    ```shell
    ~/.local/share
    ```

1. Close CHITUBOX Basic (**the order matters**).

1. Locate the folders named ðŸ“‚"chitubox2_0" and ðŸ“‚"chituboxResource", delete both folders.

    <ImageContainer
    	src={"/images/docs/en-US/faq/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/windows-path.png"}
    />

1. Restart CHITUBOX Basic.

	Cleaning the cache will erase your machine settings, please make sure you
	have a backup before cleaning the cache.

## USB Drive Issues

You might found that your printer can't read your USB drive properly sometimes. Mostly this is because your printer's control board was designed to work with USB 2.0 and FAT32 format with a volume equals to or lower than 16GB. USB 3.0 uses a larger current therefore can cause electrical interference to the control board sometimes. In summary, your USB drive should meet following requirements:

-   FAT32 format

-   USB 2.0

-   â‰¤ 16GB

-   Allocation unit size = 2048 bytes
