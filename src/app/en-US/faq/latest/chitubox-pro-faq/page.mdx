2. `Error code -1` is an internal error of the plug-in due to changing of the resolution.

Download Longer plugin <Link href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1rPRw68b3Z1oqLwc7hSmP5A9Zx0HjatbE?fbclid=IwAR2XyvSs_jCWwqXymOh9ZEvcuyKNuj-ibnmbLAmfOsZMWzjJdke71kxANwQ">here</Link>.

### Rough Model Surface after Slicing

The displayed surface quality of a sliced model may appear rough. This is because each voxel of the model is rendered after slicing, similarly to zooming into each pixel after of an image in Photoshop.

As shown in the figure, the height of each cube is the layer height set in the slice setting. The length is the length of each pixel in the horizontal direction on the screen. The width is the width of each pixel in the vertical direction on the screen. Length, width, and height constitute the volume of the voxel. A voxel is the smallest unit that constitutes a print.

	src={"/images/docs/en-US/faq/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/faq005.png"}
	style={{ maxwidth: "400px" }}
/>

<Admonition type="note">
	This voxel imaging is not visible upon the initial slice preview. You need to reload the .ctb file in CHITUBOX to view it.
</Admonition>

### Why are STL files scaled when imported into CHITUBOX?

STL files do not contain specific unit information but use numerical records. Therefore, different software may use different units to read STL files. For example, 1 meter in Blender might equate to 1 millimeter in CHITUBOX. You need to test the scale relationship between your 3D modeling software and CHITUBOX before exporting files.

## Other Issues

You may encounter other issues caused by data corruption between versions in certain cases. You can try the following ways to resolve the issue:

### Clear Cache

1. Open the log path (Setting/Help > Open Log). <Link href="/en-US/chitubox-pro/v1.4.1/application-overview/setting-and-help#open-log">ðŸ“ƒClick here</Link> to learn how to open the log.

1. Close CHITUBOX Pro (**make sure to close the software first**).

1. Ensure that CHITUBOX Pro is closed, back up the ðŸ“‚*machine* folder to another location, and then delete all files and folders except the ðŸ“„*userLogin.cfg* file.

    <ImageContainer
    	src={"/images/docs/en-US/faq/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/faq003.png"}
    />

1. Restart CHITUBOX Pro.

1. After restarting CHITUBOX Pro, a new ðŸ“‚*machine* folder will be generated. You can restore your machines by copying and pasting _.cfg_ files back to the new ðŸ“‚*machine* folder. Please do not copy all _.cfg_ files back to the ðŸ“‚*machine* folder at once as the issue you encountered might be caused by one of them.

## USB Drive Issues

Printers may fail to read certain USB drives sometimes. Usually this is because your printer's control board was designed to work with USB 2.0 with a capacity of 16GB or less. USB 3.0 uses a larger current, which can cause electrical interference with the control board. Your USB drive should meet the following requirements:

-   FAT32 format

-   USB 2.0

-   â‰¤ 16GB

-   Allocation unit size = 2048 bytes
