# Tools to Remove Support Structures and Rinse 3D Object in Resin (SLA/DLP/LCD) 3D Printing

After finishing the 3D printing process, we have to shovel the print or the failure (only raft and supports) away from build plate. Sometimes, some parts may stick to the bottom of resin vat which are also in need of removal. Due to the nettlesome support structures in Resin (SLA/DLP/LCD) 3D Printing, a lot of post-processing work has been left. There are a few tools that will make life easier when working with a resin 3D printer. So let’s highlight tools to remove support structures and rinse 3D object in resin (SLA/DLP/LCD) 3D printing.

## Protective Equipments

### Nitrile Gloves

It's better to avoid contacting uncured resin with skin. Though it's not that toxic, there's nothing wrong to wear gloves when working with uncured resin. If resin gets on your skin, immediately wash it off with soap and warm water. As for allergies, everyone is different. Some people are allergic and some are not.

### Disposable Mask (Optional)

Most uv-cured resins are methyl methacrylates which generally have a smell of exotic fragrance. Besides keep good ventilation, you can wear a disposable mask to guard against the smell.

## Cleaning Tools

### Metal Scraper

Metal scraper can help remove prints or the failures (only raft and supports) from the build plate.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="metal scraper"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/advanced/tools-to-remove-support-structures-and-rinse-3d-object-in-resin-sladlplcd-3d-printing/metal-scraper.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

This kind of metal scraper shown as above can be handy to shovel into the gap between the print and build plate due to its blade.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="small metal scraper"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/advanced/tools-to-remove-support-structures-and-rinse-3d-object-in-resin-sladlplcd-3d-printing/small-metal-scraper.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

And this small metal scraper is actually used for applying the paint on a drawing board. As a small tool, it’s easy to cut into the gaps between the print and build platform. In addition, the certain angle between the handle and the scraper makes it easy to raise the model.

### Blade

The blade is used for the same purpose as the scraper to remove prints or the failures from the build plate. Compared with the scraper, the blade is smaller, easier to operate and not easy to break the model. The skill is to hold the blade with one hand and cut it into the gap between the print and build plate at an angle of 45 degrees.

Then the thumb of the other hand pushes the blade down, and the model comes apart easily.

		}
	/>

### Plastic Scraper

A plastic scraper (or replaced by an expired credit card), is used in the event that a print fails and sticks to the FEP at the bottom of the resin vat. We recommend plastic scraper instead of metal scraper because the latter may scrape the FEP.

		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

### Silicone Scraper

Due to its softer material, silicone scraper can be used for stirring the liquid resin in the tank if their color pastes are uneven and dealing with bubbles in the liquid resin.

## Washing Tools

### Isopropyl Alcohol

Isopropyl alcohol is used for rinsing the finished print and any tools that have come in contact with resin. Just get rid of the excess resin and then drop prints into a spare container with isopropyl alcohol by volume of less than 90% vol.

### Spare Containers

Spare containers are always useful with liquid resin. They can be used to store used resin, which you will recycle, to wash your finished print (be sure that the container can be used with isopropyl alcohol), or to hold tools after they have come in contact with the resin.

		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

### Measuring Cup

Resins need to be sealed and stored. So adding the right amount of resin into the tank can avoid wasting and deterioration. CHITUBOX can intelligently calculate the required milliliters and grams of resin, then we can use a measuring cup to take a slightly excessive amount of resin compared to the calculated value and pour it into the tank.

		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

### Banister Brush

Banister brush will be super helpful when rinsing prints in isopropyl alcohol. Many times, resin on the surface of prints can’t be washed off by soaking. So you can wipe the surface lightly with a banister brush.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="banister brush"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/advanced/tools-to-remove-support-structures-and-rinse-3d-object-in-resin-sladlplcd-3d-printing/banister-brush.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

### Spray Bottle (Optional)

Some parts may not be wiped by the banister brush. A spray bottle with isopropyl alcohol inside will come into play to wash the hidden part.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		alt="spray bottle"
		src={
			"/en/academy/images/docs/advanced/tools-to-remove-support-structures-and-rinse-3d-object-in-resin-sladlplcd-3d-printing/spray-bottle.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

### Injector (Optional)

If the model is hollow and has drain holes, allow the resin to discharge. Then you can use a injector to inject alcohol to partially fill the model, cover the drain holes, and then gently shake the model to rinse the inside.

<ImageContainer>

		alt="injector"

			"/en/academy/images/docs/advanced/tools-to-remove-support-structures-and-rinse-3d-object-in-resin-sladlplcd-3d-printing/injector.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

### Magnetic Stirrer (Optional)

If you’re looking for a more advanced rinse solution, you deserve a magnetic stirrer. This tool uses a rotating magnetic field to cause magnetic capsules immersed in the isopropyl alcohol to stir the alcohol while rinsing the part.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage

		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

### Ultrasonic Cleaner

Ultrasonic cleaner use ultrasonic vibration cleaning print surface. You can also put the print in the attached filter basket and lift it directly after cleaning.

		}

</ImageContainer>

## Other Auxiliary Tools

### Stainless Steel Plates

Stainless steel plates of various sizes, shapes and depths can be used to do different kinds of things. Large square steel plates can be used for storing tools. Also when leaning the build platform against it, it will be easy to separate the print from the build platform. Deep stainless steel plates can be used to clean the print, while shallow steel plates can be labeled and temporarily used to dry or store the models.

		}

</ImageContainer>

### Glass Container

Because the capacity of ultrasonic cleaner is relatively larger, it takes a lot isopropyl alcohol one-time. As a kind of volatile liquid, the longer the time, the lower the concentration of the isopropyl alcohol. Also large amounts of isopropyl alcohol will cause a waste of cleaning. As shown above, you can pour water in the ultrasonic cleaner, place the model in a glass container filled with isopropyl alcohol, and put the glass container in ultrasonic cleaner.

### Non-dust Cloth/Paper Towels

After taking the print out of isopropyl alcohol, you may find the print surface is coated by scraps of paper if drying it by paper towels. Paper towels can be used to clean the workstation and prevent dripping on your workstation. But non-dust cloth is preferred to dry the print.

		}

</ImageContainer>

### Diagonal Cutting Pliers

The plane of diagonal cutting pliers defined by the cutting edges of the jaws intersects the joint rivet at an angle or "on a diagonal", hence the name. It is advised to cut off the support very close to the actual print. This will make sanding the part much easier.

		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

### Fine Grit Sandpaper

After removing the support structures, your model’s surface may be uneven. It is time to wet sand the model by using fine grit sandpaper. This process will not remove much material, but will do the most to polish its surface.
