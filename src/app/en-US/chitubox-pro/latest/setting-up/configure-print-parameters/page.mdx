# Configure Print Parameters

To configurate your print parameters, you need to add a printer first, if you have not added a printer yet, click <NextLink href="/en-US/chitubox-pro/latest/application-overview/start#add-machine">here</NextLink> to see how to add a printer.

One printer can have multiple profiles, you can manage your profiles in the **Slicing Profile Panel**, where you can add, delete, import, export, and reset your profiles.

In order to shorten the printing time and ensure a higher printing success rate, CHITUBOX divides the original constant speed into two speed segments, a.k.a **TSMC (Two-Stage Motion Control)**. When the printing platform is moving away from the printing face, it is allowed to move at a relatively faster speed.

Traditionally, there are only 2 sub-stages for a single motion cycle, after TSMC was introduced, we now have 4 sub-stages for a single motion cycle:

#### 2 Waiting Mode During Printing

##### 2.1 Resting Time

In order to simplify the calculation of Light Off Delay, CHITUBOX launched a new Waiting Mode During Printing, **Resting Time**, when using this mode, you simply need to fill in Rest Time Before Lift, Rest Time After Lift, Rest Time After Retract without tedious calculations.

##### 2.2 Light Off Delay

###### 2.2.1 What is Light-off Delay?

**Light-off delay** is the total time of build plate **lifts up**, **wait**, and **retract** during resin 3D printing of one layer.

It's vital for the resin to has sufficient time to be stabilized before the printer starts the process of printing the next layer. Mostly, the longer time you set for the light-off delay, the better, sharper, and higher resolution printing results you got. But if you set the light-off delay too long, the printing process gonna take you all day.

The time for **lift up** and **retract** can be various, depend on the distance of lift up, while the **wait** does not, we recommended it for 2\~3 seconds.

###### 2.2.2 Light-off Delay Calculation in CHITUBOX

To calculate the light-off delay, you will need to know lifting distance, lifting speed, and retract speed first. After figure out the total time for lifting and retracting, add additional 2\~3 seconds of wait time, you got the light-off delay.

Light-off delay = Time for lifting + Time for retracting + Wait time

An example is worth a thousand words:

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/004-setting-up-configure-printer-parameters003.2.png"
	}
/>

Here the **Lifting Distance** is 7mm, Lifting Speed is 70mm/min (1.167mm/sec), So the lifting time $T_L$ is:

$$T_L = \frac{7}{1.167} = 5.998\ \text{seconds}$$

Similarly, the **Retract Speed** is 210mm/min (3.5mm/sec), the retracting time $T_R$ is:

$$T_R = \frac{7}{3.5} = 2\ \text{ seconds}$$

If we hope the minimum wait time is longer than 2s, the light-off dela $T_{LOD}$ should:

$$T_{LOD} \geq 5.998 + 2 + 2 \approx 10\ \text{ seconds}$$

If you put a number less than$T_L + T_R$ to the **Light-off Delay**, it will not work.

#### 1. Bottom Light PWM

Light PWM for bottom layers, from ` 0` to ` 255` , controls the power of the UV light source for bottom layers.

Click <SpanA href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">here</SpanA> to learn more information about PWM.

#### 2. Light PWM

Light PWM for normal layers, from ` 0` to ` 255` , controls the power of the UV light source.

#### 3. Image Gray

Image gray levels, similar to Light PWM, instead of controlling the power of the UV light source, Image Gray controls the light transmittance of the LCD screen.

#### 4. Anti-aliasing

The triangular sawtooth of image edge is softened to achieve smoother surface effect. The continuity of edge exposure and the intensity of light transmission can be adjusted by adding or deleting pixel units with certain gray levels between adjacent triangular serrations, so as to achieve a smoother edge area.

-   _Gray Range_ : ` 0` ~ ` 255` , ` 0` stands for black, ` 255` stands for white, **designed for _.ctb_ format**. It determines the gray range that is available for anti-aliasing.

    The conversion formula for converting Grey Level in CHITUBOX Basic (`0` to `8`) to Grey Range(`0` to `255`) is:

    The first parameter of Grey Range = $\frac{256}{8}\times n - 1$ (n = 1, 2 , 3, â€¦, 8)

    The second parameter of Grey Range is `255`. When n = 0, the first parameter of Grey Range is `0`.

    For example, if you set the gray level in the Basic version to 2 (when the level is n = 2), and you want to achieve the same effect in the Pro version, then the gray range of the corresponding first parameter is:

    $$\frac{256}{8} \times 2 - 1 \ = 63$$

    | Basic(Gray Level) | Pro(Gray Range) | Color Reference                   |
    | ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | 1                 | 31\~255         | <ColorTag start={31} end={255}/>  |
    | 2                 | 63\~255         | <ColorTag start={63} end={255}/>  |
    | 3                 | 95\~255         | <ColorTag start={95} end={255}/>  |
    | 4                 | 127\~255        | <ColorTag start={127} end={255}/> |
    | 5                 | 159\~255        | <ColorTag start={159} end={255}/> |
    | 6                 | 191\~255        | <ColorTag start={191} end={255}/> |
    | 7                 | 223\~255        | <ColorTag start={223} end={255}/> |
    | 8                 | 255             | <ColorTag start={255} end={255}/> |

-   _Anti-aliasing Level_ : `2`, `4`, `8`, **designed for _.cbddlp_ format**. It determines the edge exposure time. The higher the level you select, the
    longer the exposure time will be, this will result in sharper edges, thereby decreasing
    the effect of anti-aliasing.

-   _Image Blur Enable_ : Enable/Disable image blur, **designed for _.ctb_ format**.

    -   <span>
        	_Image Blur Pixel_ : `2` ~ `8`, determines the number of pixels for
        	edge transition, the higher level you select, the softer edge would
        	be. Similar to the feather function in Photoshop.

#### 5. Shrinkage Compensation

Shrinkage compensation of the model in X, Y, and Z directions. The percentage represents the size compared to the original size, the default value is 100%.

When the percentage value is larger, the model body is larger.

When the percentage value is smaller, the model body is smaller.

#### 6. Tolerance Compensation

Inner and outer diameter compensation of normal printing layers

When a is larger, the inner diameter is shorter, and the model body is larger.

When a is smaller, the inner diameter is longer, and the model body is smaller.

When b is larger, the outer diameter is longer, and the model body is larger.

When b is smaller, the outer diameter is shorter, and the model body is smaller.

_Parity Compensation_ : Shrink designated value, effect on even layers only.
This will expand the layer if a negative value was specified.

#### 7. Bottom Tolerance Compensation

Inner and outer diameter compensation of bottom printing layers

When a is larger, the inner diameter is shorter, and the model body is larger.

When a is smaller, the inner diameter is longer, and the model body is smaller.

When b is larger, the outer diameter is longer, and the model body is larger.

When b is smaller, the outer diameter is shorter, and the model body is smaller.

<Admonition type="note">
	When the bottom layer tolerance compensation is disabled, the normal layer
	tolerance compensation will be effective for the whole model.

#### 8. Print Time Compensation

Some high-resolution printers could have extra delays when loading data and will lead to inaccurate printing time estimation, you can set up a time compensation to improve the issue.

-   **Manual Input**

    Layer Print Time Compensation: a 2-digit number between `-99.99` and `99.99`, default `0` s.

    When enabled, the Estimated Time For A Single Layer = Exposure Time + Waiting Time + Movement Time + Layer Print Time Compensation

-   **Auto Generated**

    		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/004-setting-up-configure-printer-parameters004-1.png"
    	}
    />

    Layer Print Time Compensation = $\frac{\text{Actual Printing Time - Software Forecast Time}}{\text{Layer Count}}$

#### 9. Mask

Mask is designed for a commonly seen issue that is uneven light strength from points to points on the screen and is mostly caused by improper light sources. The purpose of the mask is to provide a correction layer on the screen by adjusting the transmittance on different areas of the screen respectively, make the uneven light homogeneous.

_Mask File_ : You can select an existing image by clicking `...` icon or create a new one using CHITUBOX's built-in <NextLink href="#91-mask-generator">mask generator</NextLink> by clicking the gear icon.

##### 9.1 Mask Generator

###### 9.1.1 Hub-and-Spoke

**Hub-and-Spoke** generate a ripple-like pattern. The number of circles is set by **Number of equal parts**. Radius of circles are arithmetic sequence, increases by **Equal radius**.

The range of **Gray Parameter** is available from `0` (black) to `255` (white).

<ImageContainer
	src={

For example, if **Number of equal parts** is set to 5, **Equal radius** is set to 3mm, the radius of the ripple will be

$$5 \times 3 = 15 \text{mm}$$

###### 9.1.2 Matrix Mode

**Matrix Mode** generate a matrix-like pattern. Rows and columns are set by `m` and `n` respectively.
The range of **Gray Parameter** is available from `0` (black) to `255` (white).
For example, here is a 2 $\times$ 3 matrix with different grayscales.

	style={{ maxWidth: "350px" }}

##### 9.2 Gray scale unit

The way **Gray scale unit** work is to average the grey value of specified number of pixels in X-axis direction, and apply averaged grayscale to pixels in corresponding position of the original image.

Example:

Let's say the size of the build plate is 80mm $\times$ 120mm, the resolution of the screen is 800px $\times$ 1200px.

This is the mask picture, also with resolution of 800px $\times$ 1200px. All squares in the picture have the size of 50px $\times$ 50px.

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/004-setting-up-configure-printer-parameters004.3.png"
	}
	style={{ width: 400 }}
/>

If the **Gray scale unit** was set to 51px, the processed image will be like this:

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/004-setting-up-configure-printer-parameters004.4.png"
	}
	style={{ width: 400 }}
/>

The grayscale of the image goes gray gradually from the left to right, this is because the original image was averaged every 51 pixels in the X-axis direction.
Let's consider the first row. The grayscale of the first 51px is averaged by 50 black pixels and 1 white pixel, so it resulted in a width of 51 pixels section that is a little bit lighter than black, even though the change is not visible. The second 51px is composed of 49 white pixels and 2 black pixels, it resulted in a darker average grayscale than white. The third 51px, composed of 48 black pixels and 3 white pixels, and so forth... until there is a remainder left which is composed of 35 white pixels.

$\frac{800}{51} = 15$, remainder 35

This part will be averaged by 35 pixels themselves, therefore, the grayscale didn't change.
