ChituAction is an automated tool integrating model preparation, support creation, auto-layout and model slicing.

Click on the icon <SettingsIcon /> after loading models into the program to bring up the ChituAction sequence list. Click on the "**Apply**" button after configuring all necessary parameters and choosing paths for file saving. A slicing file and a project file can then be automatically generated with just one click.

You can also click on one of the actions within the sequence to execute a single command.

## Prepare

### Scale

When enabled, ChituAction automatically scales all models based on the preset ratio.

### Orient

When enabled, ChituAction automatically orients all models based on the preset orientation pattern.

Orientation Pattern:

-   Fixed Angle: Manually set the angle of orientation to rotate all models to the same angle.
-   Auto Orientation: Rotates all models to the orientation optimized for printing as calculated by CHITUBOX.

## Support

Add Magic Supports to all models based on your Magic Support settings.

## Layout

When printing multiple models, you can optimize the models' layout with this option to best utilize the print platform area and minimize manual model movements.

## Export/Save

Allows direct creation and saving of model files, project files and slice files upon finishing all other actions.

-   Export Model: Supported file formats include .stl, .obj, and .3mf.

-   Save Project: Supported file formats include .ctp, and .chitubox.

-   Save Slice: The default slice file format is the default format for the chosen printer.
