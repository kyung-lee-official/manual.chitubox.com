# Add, Edit and Delete

## Add Supports

### Auto Support

<Entry
	supportSettingsPanel={[
		"Support Settings Panel",
		"Auto Support",
		"Add Auto Support",
	]}
	shortcut={["Shift", "S"]}
/>

Automatically generates support structures based on support parameters and models' geometric features to save users' time and effort.

### Manual Support

<Entry
	supportSettingsPanel={[
		"Support Settings Panel",
		"Auto Support",
		<div className="flex items-center gap-1">
			<ChituboxAddSupportIcon />
			Add Support
		</div>,
	]}
	shortcut={["A"]}
/>

You can manually add supports based on your own experience and understanding of models to achieve best printing results.

#### Support Types

##### Adaptive Support

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 1"]} shortcut={["1"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/adaptive-support.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

Adaptive supports would generate suitable support intelligently to match model features.

##### Vertical Support

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 2"]} shortcut={["2"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/vertical-support.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

Place supports with contacting segments perpendicular to model surfaces.

##### Upright Support

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 3"]} shortcut={["3"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/upright-support.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

Place supports that are perpendicular to the print platform.

##### Branch Support

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 4"]} shortcut={["4"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/branch-support.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

Branch Supports are single-segment supports, usually used to connect model surface with the mid-segment of another support or connect two supports, in order to further stabilize a model.

##### Joint Support

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 5"]} shortcut={["5"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/joint-support.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

Joint Supports consists of two support segments. Similar to branch supports, they can be connected to models or other supports.

##### Small Pillar

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 6"]} shortcut={["6"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/small-pillar.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

This is a type of thin support connecting the model and another support's middle segment or connecting two points on the surfaces of a model. Smaller pillars are ideal of models with small overhangs and many details by providing fine supports to small areas.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
	Users can enable the Automatic Attachment option when using Branch, Joint
	and Small Pillar supports and customize the parameters _Attachment Radius_
	and _Attachment Angle_ in the **More Support Settings** panel under the
	"Advanced Settings" window.
</Admonition>

##### Forked Support

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 7"]} shortcut={["7"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/forked-support.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

Branch Supports connect with models on top and branch off to connect to the mid-segments of adjacent supports to form stable support grids.

##### Tree Support

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 8"]} shortcut={["8"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/tree-support.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

Tree Supports has several branching supports from the main pilar, similar to tree branch structures. Tree Supports can provide even support forces to effectively prevent model deformation.

##### Contour Support

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 9"]} shortcut={["9"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/contour-support.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

Add supports at a given height on a model.

##### Face Support

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 10"]} shortcut={["0"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/facial-support.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

Add supports to a selected face on a model.

##### Boundary Support

<Entry manualSupportOptions={["Option 11"]} shortcut={["-"]} />

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/zh-CN/chitubox-pro/2.x.x/boundary-support.png"}
	style={{ width: 65 }}
/>

Add supports to the boundary of a selected face on a model, to avoid overhang warping or breaking during printing.

### Symmetrical Support

<Entry
	functionMenu={[
		"Support",
		<div className="flex items-center gap-1">
			<SymmetricalSupport />
			Symmetrical Support
		</div>,
	]}
	shortcut={["Ctrl", "Shift", "S"]}
/>

Detect symmetrical surfaces on a model and add mirrored supports to both sides of selected symmetrical planes.

### Merge Supports

<Entry
	functionMenu={[
		"Support",
		<div className="flex items-center gap-1">
			<MergeSupport />
			Merge Supports
		</div>,
	]}
	shortcut={["Ctrl", "Shift", "M"]}
/>

Automatically merge some or all supports to simplify support structures and lower print cost.

### Add Supports to Overhangs

<Entry
	functionMenu={[
		"Support",
		"Overhang Detection",
		<div className="flex items-center gap-1">
			<AddSupportToSuspendedArea />
			Add Supports to Overhangs
		</div>,
	]}
/>

Manually or automatically add supports to overhang areas after running <NextLink href="/en-US/chitubox-pro/latest/risk-detection#overhang-detection">Overhang Detection</NextLink> can prevent overhangs from deforming or breaking during printing.

## Edit Support

<Entry
	supportSettingsPanel={[
		"Support Settings Panel",
		"Auto Support",
		<div className="flex items-center gap-1">
			<ChituboxEditSupportIcon />
			Edit Support
		</div>,
	]}
	shortcut={["E"]}
/>

Modify added supports, including adjusting support size, density and locations to optimize print results.

## Delete Support

<Entry
	supportSettingsPanel={[
		"Support Settings Panel",
		"Auto Support",
		<div className="flex items-center gap-1">
			<ChituboxDeleteSupportIcon />
			Delete Support
		</div>,
	]}
	shortcut={["D"]}
/>

Remove unnecessary support structures to save material.
