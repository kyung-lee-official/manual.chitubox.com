##### Enhanced Automatic Support

Auxillary supports with cross bracings will be added automatically to certain isolated supporting columns during Auto Support.

-   Triangular Reinforcement (TR): The program will try to automatically connect adjacent support columns to form stable triangular structures with Trianglular Reinforcement during Auto Support.

-   Global Reinforcement (GR): The program will try to inter-connect all adjacent support columns to form a more stable structure composed of small triangular structures under Global Reinforcement during Auto Support.

## Auto Support

### Auto Support Mode

<Entry shortcut={["Ctrl", "TAB"]} />

There are three modes for auto support:  **+All**, **+Platform** and **+Overhang**.

**+All** allows support generation on model surface, **+Platform** allows support generation on the platform, and **+Overhang** generates support on all overhangs.

### Auto Support Type

Auto Support type includes: Branch, Joint, Adaptive, Vertical, Upright and Small Pillar.

Choose applicable options from the support types, click the "Auto Add Support" button to generate corresponding support types.
