# Support

## Symmetrical Support

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support002.png"
	}
/>

Identify symmetrical planes of the model and manually add symetrical supports based on the chosen reference plane.

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support003.png"
	}
	style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: 710 }}
/>

## Merge Support

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-merge.png"
	}
/>

Automatically merge all applicable supports within selection.

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-merge.1.gif"
	}
	style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: 720 }}
/>

## Suspend Detection

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support001.png"
	}
/>

Detect the suspended area of the selected 3D model, and display suggested areas that need supports at the current part orientation.

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-suspend.gif"
	}
/>

<ImageComparison
	img1Src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support001.1.png"
	}
	text1={"Before suspend detection"}
	img2Src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support001.2.png"
	}
	text2={"After suspend detection"}
/>

## Left-Side Tool Bar

Under the **Support** interface, the **Left-Side Tool Bar** would change accordingly.

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support020.png"
	}
/>

Selecting specific areas with these tools allows adding, deleting, and editings supports applied on the areas.

Take the **Rectangle** tool as an example.

-   Add <br />
    By selecting the area and clicking the "+ All" or "+ Platform" button, users can apply auto-support only to that area.<br />

    <ImageContainer
    	src={
    		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support020.1.gif"
    	}
    />

-   Delete <br />
    Deletable supports within selection would turn to red  under Delete Mode.<br />

    <ImageContainer
    	src={
    		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support020.4.gif"
    	}
    />

-   Edit <br />
    Editable supports within selection would turn to green under Edit Mode.<br />

    <ImageContainer
    	src={
    		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support020.6.gif"
    	}
    />

## Support Types

The Support Type Panel at the bottom of the Viewport provides various support types to meets user needs.

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support015.png"
	}
/>

### Default

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-01.png"
	}
/>

This is the most commonly used support type, self-adaptive according customized support settings.

### Vertical

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-02.png"
	}
/>

The top segment of this type of support is parallel to the normal line of the attached surface and perpendicular to the attached surface.

### Upright

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-03.png"
	}
/>

The top segment of this type of support is perpendicular to the build plate.

### Connection

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-04.png"
	}
/>

This is for single-segment supports connecting the model and another support's middle segment. Both ends of this type of support can be attached to another support element.

### Two Points Connection

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-05.png"
	}
/>

This is for two-segment supports connecting the model and another support's middle segment.

### Small Pillar

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-06.png"
	}
/>

This is a type of thin support connecting the model and another support's middle segment or connecting two points on the surfaces of a model.

### Branch

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-07.png"
	}
/>

This type of support's top segment would connect to the model, and the bottom segment would branch into two segments and connect to two adjacent supports' middle segment.

### Contour

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-08.png"
	}
/>

This will generate supports with top segments connecting to the model at the same elevation contour.

### Tree-like

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-09.png"
	}
/>

This option is for tree-like supports.

## Support Operation

### Multi-select Supports

Hold Ctrl to select multiple support parts of the same type allows modifying their parameters in batch.

	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-operation-01.gif"
