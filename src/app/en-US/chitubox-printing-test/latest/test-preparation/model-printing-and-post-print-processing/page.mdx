# Model Printing And Post-Print Processing

## Separating the Model from the Print Platform

When separating the model from the print platform, take care to avoid damaging the printed model. This is especially important when using a separation spatula to detach brittle material models, as they can easily fracture, and when detaching flexible material models, as their insufficient strength may lead to damage.

## Model Cleaning And Drying

Ensure that all residual resin is thoroughly cleaned from the model's surface during the washing process. Avoid prolonged soaking, which could dissolve the solid model or cause secondary reactions.

After cleaning, the model must be thoroughly dried before proceeding to the next stage of post-curing.

## After Curing The Model

Appropriate post-curing time enhances the modelâ€™s curing quality, improving its overall structural integrity. However, excessively long post-curing times can cause significant deformation of the model.

## Model Storage

As this guide focuses on photopolymerized models, it is essential to store printed models under light-protected conditions to preserve their quality.
