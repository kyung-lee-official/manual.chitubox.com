# Model Printing And Post-Print Processing

## Separation of Model And Printing Platform

When the model is separated from the printing platform, care should be taken to avoid damage to the printing model. In particular, attention should be paid to the brittle fracture of the printing model when the brittle material needs to be separated with a separation blade and the damage caused by the insufficient strength of the model when the flexible material is separated.

## Model Cleaning And Drying

When cleaning the model, it is necessary to ensure that the residual resin liquid on the surface is completely cleaned, and the cleaned model must not be dissolved by the solvent or reacted twice because the cleaning and soaking time is too long.

The cleaned model needs to be fully dried before it can further enter the post-curing treatment of the next link.

## After Curing The Model

Appropriate model post-processing time helps the printed model to obtain better response sufficiency and further improve the response sufficiency of the model; too long post-curing treatment may lead to large deformation of the model.

## Model Storage

Since this guidance is mainly for the model data of light curing molding, the basic preservation of the printed model needs to meet the basic shading preservation conditions.
