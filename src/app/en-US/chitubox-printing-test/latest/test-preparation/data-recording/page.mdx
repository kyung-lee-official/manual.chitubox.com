    			Gradient hole and shaft sizes: φ0.025, φ0.5, φ1, φ3, φ5, φ10. Measure and record precise parameters using vernier calipers or micrometers: "φ xx design shaft measured as φ xx." 

				For unmeasurable small holes/shafts, record formability: Shaft: "φ x (fully formed/deformed/not fully formed)" Hole: "φ xx hole bottom blocked," "φ xx hole shows print marks," "φ xx hole not visibly printed" accordingly.
