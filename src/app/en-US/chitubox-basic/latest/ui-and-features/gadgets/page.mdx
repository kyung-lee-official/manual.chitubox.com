# Gadgets

In this section, we will introduce some useful gadgets in CHITUBOX.

<ChituboxGlobalIcon /> Global coordinate: Scale handles are parallels to the global coordinates.

<ChituboxLocalIcon /> Local coordinate: Scales handle are parallel to the model's local coordinates.

<ChituboxResetIcon /> Reset: Reset the scale to 100%.

### Mirror

<ChituboxMirrorIcon /> Mirror selected models on the platform.

## Info Panel

The Info Panel is located in the lower left of the main window. It contains basic information of current print settings.

## Machine Management Bar

The Machine Management Bar is located at bottom of the main window. Here you can add, delete, and copy printers.

Click the add machine button <ChituboxAddMachine /> to add a new printer.

Click the menu icon <ChituboxMachineBarMenuIcon />, and you can see options to Hide Platform, <ChituboxCopyAddIcon /> Copy Machine, and <ChituboxDeleteIcon /> Delete Machine.

## Support Display Mode

Click <ChituboxSupport /> to switch to the support view. There are 3 buttons allowing you to switch between different support display modes.

<ChituboxSupportDisplayAllIcon /> Display full supports.

	}
/>

<ChituboxSupportDisplayTopIcon /> Display top of supports.

<ImageContainer

## Render Mode

Rending mode options are located in the upper right of the main window. It contains two modes: Details and Fresnel.

<ChituboxRenderDetailedIcon /> In Details mode, the model shows more details on
the surface.

<ChituboxRenderFresnelIcon /> In Fresnel mode, the model appears smoother on
the surface.

## Viewport Gizmos

Viewport Gizmos are located in the upper right corner of the main window, providing an intuitive way to quickly manipulate the view, enabling users to quickly change the angle or perspective of the viewport, and facilitating the inspection of the relative position of objects.

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/005-gadget-viewport_gizmo.svg"
	}
	width={200}
/>

The Home <ChituboxHomeIcon /> icon and the Perspective <ChituboxPerspectiveIcon /> / Orthographic <ChituboxOthographicIcon /> icons are located at the upper-right of the main window, next to the viewport gizmos.

The Home icon allows users to reset the viewport to the default view. The Perspective/Orthographic icon allows users to switch between Perspective and Orthographic views. Perspective mode provides a more realistic view of the scene, while Orthographic mode gives users a flat view of the scene. Changing the view model can help users to assess the position of objects on the build plate and make adjustments as needed.

## Slider

<ImageContainer

/>

The slider is located at the right of the main window, used to preview the sectional area of models (pre-slice) and layers of models (post-slice). The slider has two buttons on the top and bottom for animating the slider position. The reset button on the bottom resets the slider position to the default levels. The slider component can help users assess the quality of the 3D model before it is sent to the printer, allowing them to make adjustments as needed.
