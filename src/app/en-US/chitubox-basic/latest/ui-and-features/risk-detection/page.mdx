# Risk Detection

## Cavity Detection

The Cavity Detection button is located on the right side of the main panel, below the file list panel.

Cavity detection helps users identify any enclosed cavities in their 3D printing model such as enclosed pockets or voids, and users can add holes to the model to avoid vacuum effects.

Here is a comparison of a hollow model with cavity detection off and on.

		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/008-risk-detection-cavity-on.png"
	}
	text2={"Cavity Detection On"}
/>

## Collision Detection

Collision detection is located on the right side of the main panel, below the file list panel.

Collision detection helps users highlight collisions in their 3D printing model, allowing users to adjust the model to avoid collisions.

<ImageComparison
	img1Src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/008-collision-detection-off.png"
	}
	text1={"Collision Detection Off"}
	img2Src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/008-collision-detection-on.png"
	}
	text2={"Collision Detection On"}
/>

## Suspension Detection

Suspension Detection is available in the support view. Click <ChituboxSupport /> to switch to the support view. Suspension Detection is located on the right side of the support view right below the support list panel.

<ImageContainer
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/008-risk-detection-suspend-detection.png"
	}
/>

Suspension Detection function helps users identify any unsupported high-risk areas in their 3D printing model, allowing users to add supports to the model to avoid print failure.

It offers three accuracy levels: Low, Medium, and High. Higher accuracy levels produce more accurate detections result, but take longer to finish detection. Click the "Refresh" button <ChituboxRefreshIcon /> to refresh the detection result.

Click the arrow in the Suspended Area panel to navigate through the detected overhangs and zoom into the corresponding area of the model.

	}
/>

## Island Detection

Island Detection is similar to Suspension Detection but detects islands by iterating 2D layers instead of 3D models. To use Island Detection, slice the model first by clicking the **Slice** button on the right side of the main panel below the file list panel.

<ImageContainer
	src={"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/008-risk-detection-slice.png"}
/>

After slicing the model, you will enter the preview window and see the **Detect Islands** and the **Delete Islands** buttons at the top of the preview window.

<ChituboxIslandsDetectionIcon /> Detect Islands will detect islands in the model
and highlight them in red in the preview viewport.

<ChituboxDeleteIslandsIcon /> Delete All Islands will delete all detected islands. Typlically you would not use this function but go back to add supports to the islands.

Click the **Delete Islands** button on the right of the main panel to delete islands on a specific layer.
