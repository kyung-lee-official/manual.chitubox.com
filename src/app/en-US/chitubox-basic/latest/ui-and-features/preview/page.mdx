# Preview

## Preview Window

After slicing, you can preview the model in the preview window. The preview window is divided into two parts: the left part is the model preview, and the right part is the layer preview.

The Print Settings panel on the bottom of the preview window displays the print settings of the current model. You can modify the print settings here before saving the sliced file.

You can check out the print info on the upper right corner of the preview window. The print info includes the **Machine Type**, **Resin**, **Volume**, **Weight**, **Price**, and **Print Time**.

## Network Sending

For printers that support network printing, a **Network Sending** button will be available on this interface. This feature allows you to directly send sliced data to the printer for printing. Clicking this button will open the <NextLink href="/en-US/chitu-manager/latest/ui-and-features/network-sending">Network Sending window</NextLink>.

<Admonition type="note">
	You need to install ChituManager to use the Network Sending function. If ChituManager is not installed on your computer, you can download and install it by following the instructions after clicking the **Network Sending** button.

## Save Files

After slicing, you can save the sliced file to your computer. Click the **Save** button on lower-right of the preview window to save the sliced file.

<Admonition type="note">
	* The file saving dialog only shows the file format supported by your printer. If you don't see the correct format from the drop-down menu, please go back and check if you have selected the correct printer.
    * The **default** printer type allows you to save the sliced file in any format supported by CHITUBOX. However, you should only select the **default** printer type when your printer doesn't have a built-in profile in CHITUBOX.
