	* The file saving dialog only shows the file format supported by your printer. If you do not see the correct format from the drop-down menu, please go back and check if you have selected the correct printer.
    * The **default** printer type allows you to save the sliced file in any format supported by CHITUBOX. However, you should only select the **default** printer type when your printer does not have a built-in profile in CHITUBOX.
