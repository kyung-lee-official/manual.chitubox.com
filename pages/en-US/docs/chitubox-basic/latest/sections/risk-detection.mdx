# Risk Detection

## Cavity Detection

Cavity detection is located on the right of the main panel right below the file list panel.

Cavity detection helps users identify any enclosed cavities in their 3D printing model such as enclosed pockets or voids, and users can add holes to the model to avoid vacuum effects.

Here is a comparison of a hollow model with cavity detection off and on.

			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/008-risk-detection-cavity-on.png"
		}
		text2={"Cavity Detection On"}
	/>

## Collision Detection

Collision detection is located on the right of the main panel right below the file list panel.

Collision detection helps users highlight collisions in their 3D printing model, and users can adjust the model to avoid collisions.

			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/008-collision-detection-off.png"
		}
		text1={"Collision Detection Off"}
		img2Src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/008-collision-detection-on.png"
		}
		text2={"Collision Detection On"}
	/>

## Suspend Detection

Suspend Detection is available in the support view, click <ChituboxSupport /> to switch to the support view. Suspend Detection is located on the right of the support view right below the support list panel.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/008-risk-detection-suspend-detection.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

The Suspend Detection function helps users identify any unsupported high-risk areas in their 3D printing model, and users can add supports to the model to avoid print failure.

It provides three accuracy levels: Low, Medium, and High. The higher the accuracy level, the more accurate the detection result, but the longer the detection time. By clicking the "Refresh" button <ChituboxRefreshIcon />, you can refresh the detection result.

Clicking the arrows in the Suspend Areas panel will automatically zoom in the corresponding area in the model.

## Island Detection

Island Detection is similar to Suspend Detection but detects islands by iterating 2D layers instead of 3D models. To use Island Detection, the model need to be sliced by clicking the **Slice** button on the right of the main panel right below the file list panel.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/008-risk-detection-slice.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

After slicing the model, you should enter the preview window and should see the **Detect Islands** and the **Delete Islands** buttons on the top of the preview window.

<ChituboxIslandsDetectionIcon /> Detect Islands will detect islands in the model
and highlight them in red in the preview viewport.

<ChituboxDeleteIslandsIcon /> Delete Islands will delete the islands that have
been detected. Mostly you don't want to use this function, instead, you probably
want to go back to add supports to the islands that have been detected. It's
only used when the detected islands only continuously exist in a few layers and
you want to delete them.
