# Configure Print Parameters

To configure your print parameters, you need to add a printer first, if you have not added a printer yet, click the add button <ChituboxAddMachine size={24} /> on the machine management bar that is located at the bottom of the main window, select a printer brand to expand the available printers, then select the printer you want to add, and click the **Next** button to add the printer.

After adding the printer, you can configure the print parameters for the printer. One printer can have multiple profiles, you can manage your profiles in the Profile Panel.

			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/009-configure-print-parameters-profile-panel.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

Where you can <ChituboxProfileDownloadIcon /> **download profiles** (from standard library or custom library), <ChituboxProfileUploadIcon /> **upload all profiles** (to custom library), <ChituboxProfileAddIcon /> **add a profile**, <ChituboxProfileImportIcon /> **import profiles** (from local), <ChituboxProfileExportAllIcon /> **export all profiles** (to local).

By hovering each configuration's menu icon <ChituboxProfileMenuIcon />, you can see the available operations for the configuration, including <ChituboxProfileUploadIcon /> upload, <ChituboxProfileRenameIcon /> rename, <ChituboxProfileExportIcon /> export, <ChituboxProfileResetIcon /> reset, <ChituboxProfileDeleteIcon /> delete.

## Machine

Here you can configure the printer's basic information, including the printer's name, machine resolution, size, etc.

### Name

The printer's name, editable, <NextLink href="/en-US/docs/chitubox-basic/latest/sections/configure-print-parameters#type">printer model type</NextLink> by default.

### Type

The model type printer, not editable.

### Mirror

Exposure image mirror mode. You don't need to change this setting in most circumstances unless you're using the default printer type (Other > default).

### Resolution and Size

The resolution and size of the print screen. You don't need to change this setting in most circumstances unless you're using the default printer type (Other > default).

The Link/Unlink buttons <ChituboxProfileLinkIcon /> allow you to link/unlink the size and resolution or X and Y. Any linked value will be updated automatically when the other value is changed.

If the size is unlinked from the resolution (resolution stays unchanged), the smaller the screen size, the larger the actual print will be, and vice versa.

<Admonition type="warning">
	The resolution must matches the actual resolution of the printer, otherwise
	the printer might report an error.
</Admonition>

### Build Area Offset

The offset of the build area. By enabling this option, you can adjust the offset to the edge of the print screen. Offset areas will not be printed. This is useful if your screen has bad points on the edge.

## Resin

Here you can configure the resin's basic information, including the resin's name, type, density, unit price, etc. CHITUBOX will use this information to calculate the resin usage and cost.

## Print

### TSMC (Two-Stage Motion Control)

You might have noticed that there are two sets of lifting and retracting parameters in the print settings, this is where you can set up TSMC.

And you might think what TSMC is and why it is needed. Let me explain.

When the build plate starts lifting, the model will be pulled up by the build plate. This is called the "suction effect". The suction effect is more obvious when the contact area with the build plate is large and when the build plate is pulled away quickly. The suction effect can cause the model to deform, and even cause the model to fall off the build plate. So you have to keep it slow at first. But once the model is lifted off the FEP film, the suction effect will disappear. At this time, you can speed up the lifting speed to improve the printing efficiency. The principle acts similarly in the retracting stage.

You can tweak around the parameters below to get familiar with TSMC.

### Bottom Light PWM

Light <SpanA href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</SpanA> for bottom layers, from `0` to `255` or from `0%` to `100%`, controls the power of the UV light source for bottom layers.

### Light PWM

Light <SpanA href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</SpanA> for normal layers, from `0` to `255` or from `0%` to `100%`, controls the power of the UV light source for normal layers.

### Image Grayscale

Similar to Light PWM, from `0` to `255`, instead of controlling the power of the UV light source, Image Grayscale controls the light transmittance of the LCD screen. The higher the value, the higher the light transmittance.

### Anti-Aliasing

There are two modes of anti-alisaing: **Gray Scale Level** and **Anti-alisaing Level (legacy)**.

#### Gray Scale Level

This mode is designed for the _.ctb_ format.

| Parameters        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Grayscale level   | Range: `0` ~ `255`. `0` stands for black, `255` stands for white. It determines the gray range that is available for anti-aliasing.                                                        |
| Image Blur Enable | Enable/Disable image blur                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Image Blur Pixel  | Available values: `2`, `3`, `4`. Determines the number of pixels for edge transition, the higher level you select, the softer edge would be. Similar to the feather function in Photoshop. |

#### Anti-alisaing Level

This is the legacy mode, designed for the _.cbddlp_ format only.

| Parameters          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anti-aliasing Level | Available values: `2`, `4`, `8`. It determines the edge exposure time. The higher the level you select, the longer the exposure time will be, this will result in sharper edges, thereby decreasing the effect of anti-aliasing. |

### Tolerance Compensation

Inner and outer diameter compensation of normal printing layers.

When a is larger, the inner diameter is shorter, and the model body is larger.

When a is smaller, the inner diameter is longer, and the model body is smaller.

When b is larger, the outer diameter is longer, and the model body is larger.

When b is smaller, the outer diameter is shorter, and the model body is smaller.

### Bottom Tolerance Compensation

Inner and outer diameter compensation of bottom printing layers

When a is larger, the inner diameter is shorter, and the model body is larger.

When a is smaller, the inner diameter is longer, and the model body is smaller.

When b is larger, the outer diameter is longer, and the model body is larger.

When b is smaller, the outer diameter is shorter, and the model body is smaller.

<Admonition type="note">
	When the bottom layer tolerance compensation is disabled, the normal layer
	tolerance compensation will be effective for the whole model.

### Print Time Compensation

Some high-resolution printers could have extra delays when loading data and will lead to inaccurate printing time estimation, you can set up a time compensation to improve the issue.

-   Manual Input
    Layer Print Time Compensation: a 2-digit number between `-99.99` and `99.99`, default `0` s.
    When enabled, the Estimated Time For A Single Layer = Exposure Time + Waiting Time + Movement Time + Layer Print Time Compensation

-   Auto Generated
