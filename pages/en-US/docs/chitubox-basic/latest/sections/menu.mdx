# Menu

Click the Menu Icon <ChituboxMenu size={24} /> on the top left corner to open the Menu.

## New Project

The "New Project" button allows you to create a new project in the software. This is where you will begin importing a 3D model file.

## Open Project

The "Open Project" button allows you to open an existing project file or load and merge the project file into the current project.

The file extension name of the project file is _.chitubox_, make sure you don't mix them up with the 3D mesh files or the sliced files.

## Save Project

The "Save Project" button allows you to save your current project to a _.chitubox_ file.

## Open

The "Open" button allows you to open 3D mesh files or sliced files.

<Admonition type="warning">
	Please note that the .ctb file is the final sliced file, which is for
	printing only under most circumstances. You **SHOULD NOT** apply 3D model
	operations to it, only a few non-model-dependent operations like exposure
	time, lift and retract speed, layer pixel editing (CHITUBOX Pro only), etc.
	are available. Please **ALWAYS** modify your models on 3D mesh formats
	(.stl, .obj, etc.).
</Admonition>

## Export Model

The "Export Model" button allows you to export all models or only the selected model from the software. You can export models in a variety of file formats. This allows you to share your models with other users or use them with other 3D software.

## Recently Opened

The "Recently Opened" button allows you to quickly open projects and 3D model files that you have previously opened in the software. It displays a list of recently opened files and projects, so you can quickly open them without having to search for them again.

## Account

The Account button allows you to sign in to your CHITUBOX account. You can create an account and log in to access additional features, such as saving your settings across multiple devices. The Account button can be found in the main menu of the software.
