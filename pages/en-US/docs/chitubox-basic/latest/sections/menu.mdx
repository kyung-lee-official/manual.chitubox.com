<Admonition type="note">
	Please note that the .ctb file is the final sliced file, which is for
	printing only under most circumstances. You SHOULD NOT apply 3D model
	operations to it, only a few non-model-dependent operations like exposure
	time, lift and retract speed, layer pixel editing (CHITUBOX Pro only), etc.
	are available. Please ALWAYS modify your models on unsliced formats (.stl,
	.obj, etc.).

C:\Users\{Your-PC-User-Name}\AppData\Local\ChiTuBox

## Setting

Display Support Auxiliary Line: whether show support auxiliary lines in model surfaces.

<Admonition type="note">
	Starting from CHITUBOX Basic v1.8.1, to improve user experience, we disabled
	support auxiliary lines calculation when loading models, this makes the
	loading process faster. If you wanna bring them back, auto support will
	calculate auxiliary lines (they will show up if you remove auto-added
	supports, but only on critical areas compared to Basic V1.8.1). We encourage
	you to judge risky areas using the red highlight instead.
</Admonition>

Auto Save Interval: the interval of auto-saving. CHITUBOX will generate a temporary _.chitubox_ project file under the **Auto Save Path** (log path by default). If CHITUBOX exits normally, the temporary project file will be removed.

Auto Save Directory: you can manually enter the directory to be saved, or select a folder as the auto-save directory.

Graphics quality: the refresh rate grade of CHITUBOX, the higher the number, the lower the refresh rate.
