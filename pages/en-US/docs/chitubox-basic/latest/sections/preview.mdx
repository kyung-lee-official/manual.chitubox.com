# Preview

## Preview Window

After slicing, you can preview the model in the preview window. The preview window is divided into two parts: the left part is the model preview, and the right part is the layer preview.

The Print Settings panel on the bottom of the preview window displays the print settings of the current model. You can modify the print settings here before saving the sliced file.

You can check out the print info on the upper right corner of the preview window. The print info includes the **Machine Type**, **Resin**, **Volume**, **Weight**, **Price**, and **Print Time**.

## Network Sending

<Admonition type="note">
	1. Your printer should have a USB drive plugged in to store received sliced
	files from your computer. 
    1. Your printer and computer must under the same LAN. 
    1. The transmission speed is limited by printer's network module, for
	most printers, it's around 500KBytes/s, therefore for large size files,
	Network Sending is not recommended. 
    1. Not all printers support Network
	Sending. Read the <SpanA href="https://wkhvloo2kw.feishu.cn/docx/Q5nbdGSnfo5EbAxgEwKccN0Rnxe">ðŸ“ƒfull compatibility list</SpanA> here.
</Admonition>

Printers support network sending will have this **Network Sending** button, which can send your sliced data to your printer directly.

<Admonition type="note">
	* The file saving dialog only shows the file format supported by your printer. If you don't see the correct format from the drop-down menu, please go back and check if you have selected the correct printer.
    * The **default** printer type allows you to save the sliced file in any format supported by CHITUBOX. However, you should only select the **default** printer type when your printer doesn't have a built-in profile in CHITUBOX.
