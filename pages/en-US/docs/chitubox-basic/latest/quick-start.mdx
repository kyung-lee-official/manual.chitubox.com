# Quick Start

This section will guide you through the most basic usage of CHITUBOX to get you hands-on as fast as possible. We will start by loading a model, adding supports, slicing the model, and finally exporting the printable file to your printer.

## Add a printer

When first launch CHITUBOX, you might need to add the printer you need. Let's say we wanna add ELEGOO Jupiter. Click the plus button <ChituboxAddMachine size={24} /> on the machine management bar, and select ELEGOO Jupiter from the list.

			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/003-quick-start-add-machines.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

Click "Next".

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/003-quick-start-configurations.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

Here you can change the configurations of the printer. For simplicity, we will use the default settings. Click "Apply".

<Admonition type="warning">
	Never change the **Resolution** and **Size** of a preset printer profile,
	this might cause the printer to report an error when reading the file.
</Admonition>

## Load Files

You can easily load existing files into CHITUBOX via the dialog window way or drag-and-drop way. Let's open a file via the dialog window way.

Click the menu button <ChituboxMenu size={24} /> on the top left corner of the main window. If you want to load up an existing project, click **Open Project**. If you want to open a 3D mesh file instead, click **Open...**. You can click <NextLink href="/en-US/docs/chitubox-basic/latest/introduction#supported-file-formats">ðŸ”—this link</NextLink> to check out the supported 3D mesh file types. Here we select a 3D mesh file that we want to slice from the computer.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/003-quick-start-open-files.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

Click "Open".

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/003-quick-start-open-files-2.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

## Add Supports

Without adding support, our model most likely not gonna print successfully given it only has a single contact point on the build plate and its height of gravitational center is above the point, it is under an extremely unstable state. Click the support icon <ChituboxSupport size={24} /> on the upper right of the main window to enter the support window.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/003-quick-start-support.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

Again, for simplicity, we only use auto-support here. Click the "Auto Support" button.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/003-quick-start-supported.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

Not bad, now we're can go ahead to slice the file.

## Slice Files

Click the file configuration button <ChituboxFileConfig size={24} /> on the top right corner to get back to the main window.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/003-quick-start-slice.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

Then click the "Slice" button on the lower right to slice the file. This process will take a while, depending on the size of the model and the complexity of the supports. It converts the 3D mesh file into a printable file that can be read by the printer.

	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/003-quick-start-slice.gif"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

## Export the Printable File

This is the final step, click the "Save" button on the lower right to open up the save dialog window.

<Admonition type="warning">
	Please do not save the sliced file directly to the USB drive, this can be
	error-prone. The recommended workflow is to save the file to your computer
	hard drive first, and then copy the file to the USB drive.

    Also, if you're planning to print something big, it is highly recommended to load the sliced file back to chitubox and preview the file see if any error can be found visually so you don't waste your time and resin print a corrupted file.

	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-basic/2.x.x/003-quick-start-save-as.png"
		}
	/>
</ImageContainer>

Here you can name the file and choose the location to save the file. Make sure to select the _.ctb_ format in the "Save as type" dropdown menu. Click "Save" to save the file.

Copy the file to your USB drive, you're good to go! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
