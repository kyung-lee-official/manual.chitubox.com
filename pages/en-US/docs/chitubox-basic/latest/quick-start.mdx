# Quick Start

This section will guide you through the most basic usage of CHITUBOX to get you hands-on as fast as possible. We will start by loading a model, adding supports, slicing the model, and finally exporting the printable file to your printer.

## Load Files

## Add Supports

## Slice Files

## Export the Printable File

export default ({ children }) => (
	<DocsLayout meta={meta}>{children}</DocsLayout>
);
