# Slice Preview

## Slice

Slice is the final step before your sliced file is generated.

Sliced your models with the selected default profile in the Slicing Profile Panel. Applied to all your models inside the printable space on the platform.

	Resin Volume is calculated by summing up voxels (area of pixel $\times$
	layer height), the algorithm is pretty simple. However, this is a
	theoretical value, it could be affected by many other factors (resin residue
	on the build plate and model surface, volatility, density change during
	curing, etc.) in the real world.

## Parameter Manager

Edit and adjust the current print slice related parameters that need to be saved.

## Network Sending

<Admonition type="note">
	1. Your printer should have a USB drive plugged in to store received sliced files from your computer.
    1. Your printer and computer must under the same LAN.
    1. The transmission speed is limited by printer's network module, for most printers, it's around 500KBytes/s, therefore for large size files, **Network Sending** is not recommended.
    1. Not all printers support **Network Sending**. Read the <SpanA href="https://wkhvloo2kw.feishu.cn/docx/Q5nbdGSnfo5EbAxgEwKccN0Rnxe">ðŸ“ƒfull compatibility list</SpanA> here.
</Admonition>

Printers support network sending will have this **Network Sending** button, which can send your sliced data to your printer directly.
