Most likely it is a software conflict issue, please quit your runtime software one by one to track down which software conflicts with CHITUBOX. After this is done, the problem should be solved for most cases.
The following software may cause the conflict:

-   Anti-virus software

-   Tabtip (In Windows Task Manager it is called Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel)

-   PowerToys

-   Google Drive

## Plugin Issues

### Surface of Models Go Rough after Slicing

After slicing the model, you may think that the quality of the image is rough, but in fact, this is the model shows every voxel through stereo rendering after sliced. As if you can see the appearance of each pixel after you zoom on image in Photoshop.

As shown in the figure, the height of each cube is the layer height set in the slice setting. The length is the length of each pixel in the horizontal direction on the screen. The width is the width of each pixel in the vertical direction on the screen. Length, width, and height constitute the volume of the voxel. A voxel is the smallest unit that constitutes a print.

	style={{ maxwidth: "400px" }}

<Admonition type="note">
	This voxel image cannot be seen during the preview after the slicing. You
	need to reload the .ctb file in CHITUBOX to see it.
</Admonition>

### Why STL files were scaled after importing to CHITUBOX?

An STL file doesn't contain the exact unit, it only contains numbers. Therefore, different software read an STL in different units. For example, when using STL file, 1m exported from Blender will be read as 1mm in CHITUBOX. You need to test the corresponding proportion of your 3D modeling software and CHITUBOX before you export your models.

## Other Issues

For some reason, you might encounter other issues caused by data corruption between versions. You can try the following ways to solve issues:

### Clean the Cache

1. Open the log path (Setting/Help > Open Log). <NextLink href="/en-US/docs/chitubox-pro/latest/application-overview/setting-and-help#open-log">ðŸ“ƒClick here</NextLink> to learn how to open the log.

1. Close CHITUBOX Pro (**the order matters**).

1. Make sure you already closed CHITUBOX Pro, back up the ðŸ“‚*machine* folder to another location, then delete all files and folders except ðŸ“„*userLogin.cfg* file.

	<StyledAntdImage
		src={"/images/docs/en-US/faq/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/faq003.png"}
	/>

1. Restart CHITUBOX Pro.

1. Optional, after restarting CHITUBOX Pro, a new ðŸ“‚*machine* folder will be generated, you can restore your machines by copying and pasting _.cfg_ files back to the new ðŸ“‚*machine* folder. Please do not copy all _.cfg_ files back to the ðŸ“‚*machine* folder at once given the bug you encountered might be caused by one of them.

## USB Drive Issues

You might found that your printer can't read your USB drive properly sometimes. Mostly this is because your printer's control board was designed to work with USB 2.0 and FAT32 format with a volume equals to or lower than 16GB. USB 3.0 uses a larger current therefore can cause electrical interference to the control board sometimes. In summary, your USB drive should meet following ments:

-   FAT32 format

-   USB 2.0

-   â‰¤ 16GB

-   Allocation unit size = 2048 bytes
