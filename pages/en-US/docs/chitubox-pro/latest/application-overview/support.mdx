## Symmetrical Support

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support002.png"
	}
/>

Identify the symmetry plane of the model and manually add symmetry supports according to the set symmetry plane.

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support003.png"
	}
	style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: 710 }}
/>

## Merge Support

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-merge.png"
	}
/>

Automatically merge all or part of the selected supports.

		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-merge.1.gif"
	}
	style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: 720 }}
/>

## Suspend Detection

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support001.png"
	}
/>

Detect the suspended area of the selected 3D model, and recommend to display the recommended area and location of the support under the current layout orientation.

<ImageContainer>
	<AntdImage
		src={
			"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-suspend.gif"
		}
		/>

<ImageComparison

	img2Src={

	}
	text2={"After suspend detection"}

## Left-Side Tool Bar

In the **Support** interface, the **Left-Side Tool Bar** changed accordingly.

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support020.png"
	}
/>

These tools are provided for selecting a specific area, and apply add, delete, and edit operations to supports inside of it.

Let's take the **Rectangle** as an example.

-   Add <br />
    When the area has been selected, auto-support will only apply to that area.<br />

    <AntdImage
    	src={
    		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support020.1.gif"
    	}
    />

-   Delete <br />
    Under delete mode, selected supports turn to red color, indicate they are deletable.<br />

    <AntdImage
    	src={
    		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support020.4.gif"
    	}
    />

-   Edit <br />
    Under edit mode, selected supports turn to green color, indicate they are editable.<br />

    <AntdImage
    	src={
    		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support020.6.gif"
    	}
    />

## Support Types

On the bottom of the Viewport, the support type panel provides various support types to meets your demands.

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support015.png"
	}
/>

### Default

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-01.png"
	}
/>

This is the most commonly used support, self-adaptive according to your support settings.

### Vertical

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-02.png"
	}
/>

The top part of this type of support is parallel to the normal line of the model's surface and perpendicular to the model's surface.

### Upright

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-03.png"
	}
/>

The top part of this type of support is perpendicular to the build plate.

### Connection

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-04.png"
	}
/>

This is single-segment support, which connects the model and another support's middle part. Allow both ends to be added to the support.

### Two Points Connection

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-05.png"
	}
/>

This is two-segment support, which connects the model and another support's middle part.

### Small Pillar

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-06.png"
	}
/>

This is a type of thin support, which connects the model and another support's middle part or connects two points on the surface of a model.

### Branch

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-07.png"
	}
/>

This type of support's top part connects to the model, the bottom part was divided into two segments and connect to the adjacent two support's middle part.

### Contour

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-08.png"
	}
/>

This will generate a bunch of supports whose top parts are connected to the model at the same contour.

### Tree-like

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-type-09.png"
	}
/>

This allow you to add tree-like support.

## Support Operation

### Multi-select Supports

Hold Ctrl to select multiple homotype support parts you need to edit, then you can modify their parameters at the same time.

<AntdImage
	src={
		"/images/docs/en-US/chitubox-pro/1.x.x/006-application-overview-support-operation-01.gif"
	}
/>

export default ({ children }) => (
	<DocsLayout meta={meta}>{children}</DocsLayout>
);
